# output -----------------------------------
# {'joke': 'Why did the cricket go to the doctor? \n\nBecause it was feeling a bit wicket! üòÇ üèè \n', 'explanation': 'This joke uses wordplay on the word "wicket." \n\n* **Normal meaning:** A wicket is a structure with two wooden pieces, usually made of planks, placed on a field to be a target for the bowlers on a cricket pitch.\n* **Joke meaning:**  "Wicket" in the joke sounds similar to "wicket", meaning it refers to a person feeling *pitiful or defeated.* \n\nTherefore, the cricket went to the doctor because it was feeling "a bit wicket", a nonsensical but humorous way of saying that the cricket is feeling unwell. \n\nThe humor comes from the childishly amusing contrast between the two meanings, and the use of "wicket" in a typical phrase associated with cricket.  \n\n\nLet me know if you\'d like another joke explanation! \n'}
