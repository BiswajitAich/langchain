The Hidden Library
Emma had always been fascinated by old books. One evening, while exploring her grandmother’s attic, she stumbled upon a dusty wooden door she had never noticed before. Intrigued, she pushed it open and found herself in a dimly lit library filled with ancient tomes and handwritten scrolls.

As she ran her fingers along the spines of the books, she noticed one that stood out—a deep blue leather-bound volume with no title. She opened it, and the words inside began to glow. The book whispered secrets of lost civilizations, forgotten spells, and the mysteries of time itself.

Emma realized this wasn’t just any library. It was a gateway to knowledge long buried by history. And she was its new keeper.
